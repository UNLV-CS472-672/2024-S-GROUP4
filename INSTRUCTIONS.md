## Running on Your Machine
  *  First, fork the repo and make your appropriate branches
  *  On your local machine, navigate to the small-talk folder
  *  Run the command **npm install** to install necessary dependencies
  *  Run the command **npm run dev** in your command line to compile and run the app locally
    *  Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the site hosted on your machine. Whenever you save changes, this will update in real time.
