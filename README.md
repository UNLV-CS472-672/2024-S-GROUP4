# Small Talk
SmallTalk is a web application designed to create a virtual community for children in hospitals, allowing them to connect with peers facing similar health challenges.

## Overview
This project is born from a vision to blend social support, entertainment, and direct communication with healthcare teams into a single, child-friendly platform. While our ultimate ambition includes a comprehensive suite of features aimed at enhancing the hospital experience for young patients, this prototype will focus on core functionalities achievable within the scope of this semester.

## Features
- Create a verified account as a patient, alumni that has recovered, parent of patient, or hospital faculty
- Reach out to Doctors or Nurses virtually
- Interact with other patients virtually
- Have access to any hospital services digitally
- Have a visible calendar and notification bar that tells you the plans for the day and future events of the month.

## Planned Features
This list is what we will strive to achieve during this semester, while not the core functionality of the application, lists our plans and goals we wish to achieve in the project.

Once a planned feature is successfully implemented it will be moved from this list into the features list.
